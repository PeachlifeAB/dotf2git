# dotf2git

A simple tool for backing up your dot files to your own GitHub account.

## Initial setup

1. Create a new **private** repository on your GitHub account, name it dotf2git. Don't add any files to it.
2. Open a Terminal and run:

```bash
cd ~ && git clone git@github.com:PeachlifeAB/dotf2git.git && dotf2git/backup
```

This will set the remotes up for you and ensure you easily can receive latest features and bug fixes.

## Use

To sync and back up your dotfiles, run:

```bash
~/dotf2git/backup
```

## Get latest features and updates

```bash
~/dotf2git/update
```

This will pull latest upstream changes to your personal version of this repo.

## Multiple computers

**Supported**
Just clone your private version of this repo on each computer and run:

```bash
~/dotf2git/backup
```

The script will create a new branch named after each computerâ€™s hostname, ensuring separate backups for each machine.

Since dotf2git is based on git you can checkout and pull any computer branch locally to copy files between computers.

## Missing some dot files?

Add a file name to the .whitelist file created for your computer on first run.
